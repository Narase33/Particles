# Particles

This is a hobby Project, simply for fun.

The goal of this project is to create a particle simulation. How far this simulation goes is not determined yet, but I want to watch it. That means I'm either aiming for ~30FPS or try to embedd a library that allows me to record the simulation into some kind of video format.

I'm a (non-game related) software dev, not physicist. All I know about gravity physics, graphics or simulations I have learned doing this project. There may be some mistakes I'm not aware of. If you find some, I'm happy to learn.

I try to keep this project as self-contained as possible. If you want to clone this project and run on your own, I'll try to make that as easy as I can.
